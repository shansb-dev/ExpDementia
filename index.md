## What is expDementia?

ExpDementia is a educational experience which aims to teach teenagers the effects of dementia.

The program itself is a 3D, first-person, point-and-click interactive scenery. The user finds himself inside the body of a person who perceives the world similarly as a dementia patient would. The focus will be on replicating the effects of memory and coordination loss as well as reasoning and judgement deficiencies.
The mentioned phenomena serve the purpose to demonstrate the difficulties people with dementia have to deal with in their everyday lives. 
In the end the experience should raise awareness for dementia and help understanding people who suffer from this.
